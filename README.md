### Experimental monsters
Experimental monsters are all other monsters in the game files that are not listed above. These monsters are still accessible if you enable the **Extended mode ('0' digit key)** while in Player mode.

Once enabled you will be able to see the full list of monsters to spawn and control for the current level. **These monsters are NOT stable yet so use at your own risk!**

## Mod controls
There are 3 player control modes while using the mod, **Player, Ghost and Monster** modes.

### Player mode
This is just the default player mode as if you were playing the game with a few extra keys.

- **F1 (function key)**: Enter Ghost mode.
- **O key/P key**: Switch the current target. The target is where you will spawn when you enter Ghost mode.

### Ghost mode
This mode lets you roam around the map without being seen. Once you are in this mode you will be able to spawn and control monsters where you are standing.

>  **Mic will be set to push to talk while in this mode**.

- **Function keys**: Depending on the map you'll be able to spawn and control different monsters.
- **Shift**: Run.
- **Space**: Jump.
- **E**: Open doors.
- **Esc**: Exit Ghost mode and return to Player mode.

### Monster mode
This mode gives you direct control over a monster. [Monsters have unique primary and secondary skills](#monster-abilities).


>  **Mic will be set to push to talk while in this mode**.


- **LMB\***: The monsters primary skill.
- **RMB\***: The monsters secondary skill.
- **F1 (function key)**: Toggle between AI and player-controlled modes.
- **Shift**: Run.
- **E**: Open doors.
- **Esc**: Exit the monster mode and return to Ghost mode.

> *\*NOTE: Not all monsters will have a primary and secondary. Some monsters attack by just being near the player.*

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/). This is used to load and run the mod.
2. Download this mod and place the `ControlCompany.dll` into your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## FAQ
### Does the mod work in multiplayer lobbies?
Yes.

### Does everyone need to have the mod?
**No! Absolutely not.** Only the game host (i.e. you) needs to run the mod! Where's the fun if everyone knows you're controlling the monster? ;)

### Do I need to host the game for the mod to work?
Yes, to give you the ability to spawn and control the monsters you **must host the game**. If you are not the host the mod will show you an error message.

### Why can't I see a certain monster while in Ghost mode?
There are three possible cases. 
1. The monster is not available in the mod (yet).
2. The current map does not allow that monster to be spawned. For example, you cannot spawn the Jester in Vow because it cannot normally spawn in Vow.
3. The monster is an indoor/outdoor monster and the Ghost mode is not indoor/outdoor respectively. For example, you cannot spawn a Nutcracker outside.

### Will you add more monsters in the future?
Yes! We will add monsters and update the mod as we work out some of the issues. The current list are all the monsters we feel are stable. 


> *\*NOTE: If you would like to access ALL monsters in the game you can do so by enabling [Extended mode](#extended-mode). Going back into Ghost mode will show the list of ALL monsters in the game for the current map.*
